# Modeling the behaviour of players in *Settlers of Catan* games 

This repository contains the code implemented during work on my diploma thesis for the Technical University of Crete, department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, titled 
**Exploiting linguistic data formodeling playersâ€™ behaviour instrategic board games**.

## Thesis Abstract

Certain games exhibit social aspects realized often via natural
language exchanges. Unfortunately few attempts have been made in
taking into account both actions and linguistic information for
modeling an agent. In this internship our goal we will attempt to
leverage both kinds of information in order to create a model that is
capable of emulating a player's actions taking into account previous
actions by all players in the past as well as their linguistic
exchanges. Recent advances in neural network architectures and more
precisely recurrent models allow to sequentially update
representations of the game state or linguistic data as well as
sharing of parameters between disparate representations. We will aim
thus to use combined representations both for the game state and for
the linguistic exchanges in order to model the actions of a player

In order to achieve that we will the data collected and annotated with
discourse structure in the context of the ERC Advanced Grant project
STAC. In a first phase Recurrent Neural Networks Architectures (such
as LSTMs) will be investigated.
